# Address Book Project Documentation

## 1. Overview

The Address Book project is a C-based console application that provides functionality to manage personal contacts. It's designed with a modular approach allowing users to create, search, edit, delete, list, and save contacts persistently. The application follows standard C programming practices with a focus on data validation, error handling, and file I/O operations for data persistence.

The system stores contact information including names, phone numbers, and email addresses. It implements various validation rules to ensure data integrity (e.g., names must contain only alphabetic characters, phone numbers must be 10 digits, emails must follow a standard format). The application also handles duplicate entries by preventing users from adding contacts with the same phone number or email address.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Contact Management
- **Create Contact**: Add new contacts with validated name, phone number, and email address
- **Search Contact**: Find contacts by name, phone number, or email address
- **Edit Contact**: Modify existing contact information with full validation
- **Delete Contact**: Remove contacts from the address book
- **List Contacts**: Display all saved contacts

### 2.2 Data Persistence
- **Save Contacts**: Write all contacts to a file ("contacts.txt")
- **Load Contacts**: Read contacts from file during initialization
- **Auto-load**: Automatically load previously saved contacts when the program starts

### 2.3 Data Validation
- **Name Validation**: Names must contain only alphabetic characters and spaces
- **Phone Validation**: Phone numbers must be exactly 10 digits
- **Email Validation**: Emails must follow the format "xxx@yyy.com" (with alphabetic characters after @)
- **Duplicate Check**: Prevents duplicate phone numbers and email addresses

### 2.4 Special Handling
- **Multiple Matches**: When multiple contacts share the same name, the system asks for additional information (phone number) to identify the specific contact
- **Error Messages**: Clear error messages guide users when input validation fails

## 3. Workflow

### 3.1 Application Startup
1. The program initializes the address book structure
2. It attempts to load existing contacts from "contacts.txt"
3. If the file doesn't exist, it starts with an empty address book
4. The main menu is displayed to the user

### 3.2 Menu Interaction
The user interacts with the application through a menu-driven interface:
```
Address Book Menu:
1. Create contact
2. Search contact
3. Edit contact
4. Delete contact
5. List all contacts
6. Save contacts
7. Exit
```

### 3.3 Contact Creation Process
1. User selects "Create contact" from the menu
2. System prompts for name, validates input (alphabetic characters only)
3. System prompts for phone number, validates input (10 digits only)
4. System checks for duplicate phone numbers
5. System prompts for email, validates format and checks for duplicates
6. Contact is added to the address book in memory

### 3.4 Search Functionality
1. User selects "Search contact" from the menu
2. System offers search options (by name, phone, or email)
3. User enters search criteria
4. System performs validation on the search term
5. System displays matching contacts or error message
6. For name searches with multiple matches, system prompts for phone number to identify the specific contact

### 3.5 Edit Functionality
1. User selects "Edit contact" from the menu
2. System offers edit options (name, phone, or email)
3. User provides current information to identify the contact
4. System verifies the contact exists
5. User provides new information
6. System validates new information and checks for duplicates
7. System updates the contact information

### 3.6 Delete Functionality
1. User selects "Delete contact" from the menu
2. System prompts for name to identify the contact to delete
3. If multiple contacts match the name, system requests phone number for confirmation
4. System deletes the contact and adjusts the contact array

### 3.7 Data Persistence
1. User selects "Save contacts" from the menu or "Exit"
2. System writes all contacts to "contacts.txt"
3. File format: first line contains the number of contacts, followed by one contact per line in the format "name,phone,email"

## 5. Interview Questions and Answers

### 5.1 Design and Implementation

**Q: Explain the modular design approach you've taken in this project.**  
**A:** I've implemented a modular design by dividing functionality into separate files based on responsibilities. Each file handles a specific operation (create, search, edit, delete, list, save) on the address book. This approach improves code readability, maintainability, and allows for easier debugging and testing. The program uses a common header file to share structure definitions and function declarations across modules.

**Q: How does your application handle data persistence?**  
**A:** The application uses file I/O operations to achieve data persistence. Contacts are saved to a text file ("contacts.txt") using the `saveContactsToFile()` function, which writes the contact count followed by contact details in CSV format. During initialization, the `loadContactsFromFile()` function reads this file to restore the previous state. The user can explicitly save contacts through the menu, and the application manages file opening, writing, and closing with appropriate error handling.

**Q: Describe your approach to input validation in this project.**  
**A:** I've implemented comprehensive validation for all user inputs:
1. Names are validated to contain only alphabetic characters and spaces
2. Phone numbers must be exactly 10 digits
3. Email addresses must follow the format xxx@yyy.com with alphabetic characters after @
4. The system checks for duplicates in phone numbers and email addresses
Each validation has specific error messages to guide users. This approach ensures data integrity and provides a better user experience by preventing invalid data entry.

**Q: How does your application handle the case of multiple contacts with the same name?**  
**A:** When the system encounters multiple contacts with the same name during search, edit, or delete operations, it informs the user of the ambiguity and requests additional information (specifically the phone number) to identify the exact contact. This approach maintains usability while handling non-unique identifiers gracefully.

### 5.2 Technical Implementation

**Q: Explain how you've implemented the contact deletion process.**  
**A:** The deletion process involves:
1. Identifying the contact to delete (by name, with phone number if multiple matches)
2. Once found, shifting all subsequent contacts one position left in the array to fill the gap
3. Decrementing the contact count to reflect the removal
This approach avoids leaving empty slots in the array and maintains contiguous storage of contacts.

**Q: What memory management considerations did you make in this project?**  
**A:** The project uses a fixed-size array to store contacts, which eliminates the need for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, preventing memory leaks. The maximum number of contacts is defined by MAX_CONTACTS. For string operations, I use the safer string functions like `strcmp()` and `strcpy()` with properly sized buffers to prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, all file pointers are properly closed after operations to prevent resource leaks.

**Q: How would you modify the code to handle internationalization of phone numbers?**  
**A:** To handle international phone numbers, I would:
1. Modify the phone field in the Contact structure to accommodate longer numbers
2. Update the validation logic to accept country codes (e.g., +1, +91)
3. Allow for various formats including spaces, hyphens, or parentheses
4. Implement a standardization function to store numbers in a consistent format internally while displaying them in a user-friendly format

**Q: Explain the file format you've chosen for storing contacts.**  
**A:** I've chosen a simple CSV format where:
1. The first line contains the number of contacts
2. Each subsequent line represents one contact in the format "name,phone,email"
This format is:
- Human-readable for debugging purposes
- Simple to parse and generate
- Space-efficient (no unnecessary delimiters or formatting)
- Compatible with other applications (can be imported into spreadsheets)

### 5.3 Problem Solving

**Q: How would you optimize the search functionality for a very large address book?**  
**A:** For a large address book, I would implement:
1. Indexing: Create separate indexes for name, phone, and email fields
2. Sorting: Keep contacts sorted by name for faster binary search
3. Hashing: Implement hash tables for O(1) lookups by phone or email
4. Pagination: Display results in pages instead of all at once
5. Caching: Store recent search results for faster access
6. Consider a database backend instead of a flat file for large datasets

**Q: How would you handle concurrent access to the address book in a multi-user environment?**  
**A:** To handle concurrent access, I would:
1. Implement file locking to prevent simultaneous writes
2. Use a transactional approach for saving changes (write to temp file, then rename)
3. Implement optimistic concurrency control with version numbers
4. Add timestamps to detect and resolve conflicts
5. Consider moving to a client-server architecture with a proper database
6. Implement proper error handling for access denied scenarios

**Q: What data structure would you use if the contact list needed to be frequently sorted by different criteria?**  
**A:** I would implement:
1. A linked list or dynamic array to allow for efficient insertions and deletions
2. Multiple indices for different sort criteria (name, date added, etc.)
3. Alternatively, use a balanced tree structure (like an AVL tree or Red-Black tree) for each sort criteria
4. Implement a composite pattern to allow for complex sorting rules
5. Consider using a database with appropriate indices for very large datasets

### 5.4 Code Quality and Best Practices

**Q: How have you ensured code quality and followed best practices in this project?**  
**A:** I've ensured code quality through:
1. Modular design with clear separation of concerns
2. Consistent error handling and user feedback
3. Comprehensive input validation
4. Clear and descriptive variable and function names
5. Comments explaining non-obvious code sections and function purposes
6. Consistent formatting and indentation
7. Avoidance of magic numbers and redundant code
8. Proper file handling with resource cleanup

**Q: How would you test this application to ensure it functions correctly?**  
**A:** I would implement:
1. Unit tests for each module (create, search, edit, delete, etc.)
2. Boundary tests for validation logic (empty inputs, maximum length inputs)
3. Integration tests for the complete workflow
4. Error handling tests with invalid inputs
5. File I/O tests for persistence
6. Stress tests with large numbers of contacts
7. Manual testing for user interface experience
8. Automated regression tests to ensure changes don't break existing functionality
